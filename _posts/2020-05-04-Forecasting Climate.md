The real key motivation of this project is to be educated about an issue that does not only impact my community directly but impacts the future of humanity. Today, May 3, 2019, marks as one of days in the coronavirus pandemic here in the USA and it has come of my conscious to work on a project related to covid-19 using my skills. Although permafost is unlikely the cause of coronavirus, it is one of the known ways of how such deadly virus can appear and spread like fire. In conclusion, I have decided to work on a small scale project to simply predict the climate change in Delhi, India. I believe learning the change of such trend and to forecast climate will help determine future climate expectations and prepare the extend of impact. 

The question I addressed is:
#### â€¢ What is the forecasted temperature of the next few month's in Delhi, India? 


In order to execute this project it required my knowledge of time series such as the understanding of ACF and ACF datas, differencing, transformation, modeling, and residual diagnostic testing. Key results I found was.
