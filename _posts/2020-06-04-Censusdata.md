#### Our research question :
#### * What socioeconomic qualities lead to a higher income in US adults? 

#### * What qualities influence economic outcome the most?



The data was extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. The records follow these following conditions : ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0)). With this dataset obtained from UCI datasets source, we will model to predict the income whether a person makes over 50K or not. 


My project partner and I decided to gain insight and predicitons through random forest and KNN (K-nearest neighbor).
