The goal of this report is to identify if any of the parameters gathered has a significant effect on the success rate of a student in mathematics. We attempt to estimate exactly how effective these circumstances are to a students success, and thereby draw conclusions on what other information should be gathered, or what else to test.

We consider the following research questions:
1. Does the mother’s education or the fathers education have a bigger impact on their childs success?
2. Does the gender of the child play affect how much their mother or fathers education impacts their academic success?
* Does the mothers education impact the female students academic success? • Does the mothers education impact the male students academic success? • Does the fathers education impact the male students academic success?
* Does the fathers education impact the female students academic success?
