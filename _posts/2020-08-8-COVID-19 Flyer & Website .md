I came across Michelle Obama's podcast one day and one realization stuck with me all week. 

"Government don't have fundings to market" 

I did my part of informing myself and understanding different health cautions that should be taken and models shown by South Korea and Italy. I realized the depth and seriousness of the effect it was making in the world. For example, it's almost impossible to predict the trend of cases in America by using different models given by South Korea, Italy, and more. Second, coronavirus is not impacted by seasonally. The study revealed that such realization leads us to understand how much human decisions are impacting the trend of cases. 


I realized that the Government just don't have enough funding to inform people and warn people of how much their choices were being impacted. As a recent post-grad student, I wanted to make a difference in my college town community by UCSB, Isla Vista. 

With the given skills, interest, and growth area I had with me I decided: 

1. Make a flyer from scratch. 
2. Learn HTML and CSS and make the simplest website.
3. Make tableau data visualization to highlight important factors.
