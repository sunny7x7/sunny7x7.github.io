Post I uploaded on "Facebook : Free and For Sale (UCSB)" : 


Hi Isla Vista! My name is Sunny Hong and I am a graduating senior at UCSB with a major in Data Science and Statistics. I wanted to ask for support on a small project that I started to encourage both the community and visitors of Isla Vista to take safety precautions in the midst of coronavirus! As many of you know, there has been a significant increase in COVID-19 cases within IV. Sometimes we just need a reminder that WE ALL CARE to take small but cooperative actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Isla Vista. Here’s how you can help me spread this reminder…

I decided to make 2 flyers targeting different audiences, both of which include a QR code leading to a non-commercial website. This website includes very basic information on what we can be doing. I’ve also added a LIVE dashboard that has the total number of active cases in IV at the moment, confirmed cases in IV, as well as total cases in Santa Barbara county. Each of these numbers are updated daily.
Feel free to print the flyers and put them up anywhere they are legal! Check out the website daily if you need a page that can update you with growing/decreasing cases.

I’ve picked up on basic HTML, CSS, and designing skills over the month to make this work! Feel free to message me if you have any ideas to grow this project!
Message me with feedback & other than that comment below and help me spread the message!
