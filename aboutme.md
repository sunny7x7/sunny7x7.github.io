Hi! My name Sunny Hong and I recently graduated with a degree of Statistics and Data Science at University of California, Santa Barbara. Yes, I am the class of 2020. Before we can empathize together on the year of [coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-timeline.html), [heightened racial profiling of asian](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/20/us/coronavirus-racist-attacks-against-asian-americans/index.html), and [Black Lives Matter movement](https://keyt.com/news/top-stories/2020/05/31/black-lives-matter-protest-to-take-place-in-santa-barbara/) I would love to tell about myself. 

My college years has been always about serving the community. I served as a community team (2018) and women's team (2019-2020) with an Asian American Christian Organization affiliated with CRU, called [Epic](https://www.cru.org/epicmovement/).
