Hi! My name Sunny Hong and I recently graduated with a degree in Statistics and Data Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Yes, I am the class of 2020. This year has been a concentrated time of relearning, reeducating, and sacrificing in the light of coronavirus, heighten racial profiling, and Black Lives Matter movements. 


To tell you about myself, my college years has been always about serving the community. I served as a community team (2018) and womenâ€™s team (2019-2020) with an Asian American Christian Organization affiliated with CRU, called [Epic](https://www.cru.org/epicmovement/). I also lead the marketing team and my project group for the Data Science club at UCSB, a club dedicated to teaching students about Data Science and provided the resources and space to create projects. I realized my strengths in empathizing, being sincere, and giving. I've also led many teams and events with initiative and confident leadership. 

I have worked at **YMCA Channel Islands Office** and at the **Geography Department UCSB.** 

I have interned as a **Data Scientist** the past year with **YMCA Channel Islands** with **Jill Muchow Rode**, my supervisor as well as the Chief Development Officer of the Y. I got to start on my very own project with the data provided. I was able to build a map that showed the impact of donors on the work of the Y. I researched on the language used through NLP using great impactful nonprofit organization websites. I've also worked on topic modeling to build impactful stories for my impact map. Through Power BI, a business analytics service, I was able to build an interactive map to target both older and newer generations audiences.


I am currently continuing my **research assistant** position with **Professor Elizabeth Ackert** at the Geography Department of UCSB. As a research assistant for the **"Latinx Destinations and Health Project"** I assist the team with my data manipulation and data analysis skills. One of our aims is to compare health care supply across Latino/a destination. As the research assistant, I use R and RSQL to manipulate multiple data sets to prepare for multivariate analysis.
